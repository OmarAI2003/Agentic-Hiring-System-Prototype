## How the Challenge Went & Technology Feedback

Building this Agentic Hiring System was an incredibly rewarding experience that showcased the power of combining multiple AI agents into a cohesive automated workflow - the challenge pushed me to think beyond simple automation and implement true agentic behavior where AI makes contextual decisions at each stage. The technology stack, particularly **Groq's Llama 3.1 API** for ultra-fast LLM inference and **Flask's microservices architecture**, proved to be the perfect combination for building a production-ready system on a $0 budget, though I found managing the async coordination between three separate services (HR Panel, Onboarding, and MCQ) to be the most technically challenging aspect that required careful event-driven design.
